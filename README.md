# Sandbox Magic

A collection of techniques, patterns, and examples for creating rich, interactive content in Databricks notebooks using **Diagrams as Code** principles.

## Overview

This repository showcases various "magic" techniques for enhancing Databricks notebooks with:

- Styled code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Informative admonitions and callout boxes
- Vendor icons from popular platforms
- Mermaid diagrams for flowcharts, sequences, and more
- PlantUML diagrams for UML and architecture
- C4 architecture diagrams

## Notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [intro.ipynb](./intro.ipynb) | Overview of the repository and Diagrams as Code concepts |
| [icons.ipynb](./icons.ipynb) | Vendor icons (AWS, Azure, Databricks, Snowflake, etc.) |
| [admonitions.ipynb](./admonitions.ipynb) | Info boxes, warnings, notes, and other callouts |
| [codeblocks.ipynb](./codeblocks.ipynb) | Styled code blocks with syntax highlighting (light/dark mode) |
| [mermaid.ipynb](./mermaid.ipynb) | Mermaid diagrams - flowcharts, sequences, ER diagrams, and more |
| [plantuml.ipynb](./plantuml.ipynb) | PlantUML diagrams for UML and architecture |
| [c4_plantuml.ipynb](./c4_plantuml.ipynb) | C4 architecture diagrams using PlantUML |

## Key Technologies

- **[Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/)** - Free SVG icons for popular brands
- **[Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/)** - Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)** - JavaScript-based diagramming
- **[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)** - UML diagrams from text
- **[C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML)** - C4 model diagrams

## What is Diagrams as Code?

Diagrams as Code is an approach where diagrams and visualizations are defined using text-based markup languages. Benefits include:

- **Version Control** - Track diagram changes alongside code
- **Consistency** - Standardized styling across documentation
- **Maintainability** - Easy updates without specialized tools
- **Collaboration** - Review diagrams using standard code review processes
- **Reproducibility** - Diagrams are always generated from source

## Usage

Import these notebooks into your Databricks workspace and explore the examples. Each notebook contains:

- Working examples you can copy and customize
- Template code for creating your own diagrams
- Links to official documentation

## Reference Examples

The `ref_examples/` folder contains additional reference implementations from real-world usage.
