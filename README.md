# Sandbox Magic

A collection of techniques, patterns, and examples for creating rich, interactive content in Databricks notebooks using **Diagrams as Code** principles.

## Overview

This repository showcases various "magic" techniques for enhancing Databricks notebooks with:

- Styled code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Informative admonitions and callout boxes
- Vendor icons from popular platforms
- Mermaid diagrams for flowcharts, sequences, and more
- PlantUML diagrams for UML and architecture
- C4 architecture diagrams

## Notebooks

| [03 - Admonitions.ipynb](./03%20-%20Admonitions.ipynb) | Info boxes, warnings, notes, and other callouts |
| [04 - Codeblocks.ipynb](./04%20-%20Codeblocks.ipynb) | Styled code blocks with syntax highlighting (light/dark mode) |
| [05 - Mermaid.ipynb](./05%20-%20Mermaid.ipynb) | Mermaid diagrams - flowcharts, sequences, ER diagrams, and more |
| [06 - Plantuml.ipynb](./06%20-%20Plantuml.ipynb) | PlantUML diagrams for UML and architecture |

## Key Technologies

- **[Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/)** - Free SVG icons for popular brands
- **[Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/)** - Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)** - JavaScript-based diagramming
- **[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)** - UML diagrams from text
- **[C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML)** - C4 model diagrams

## What is Diagrams as Code?

Diagrams as Code is an approach where diagrams and visualizations are defined using text-based markup languages. Benefits include:

- **Version Control** - Track diagram changes alongside code
- **Consistency** - Standardized styling across documentation
- **Maintainability** - Easy updates without specialized tools
- **Collaboration** - Review diagrams using standard code review processes
- **Reproducibility** - Diagrams are always generated from source

## Usage

Import these notebooks into your Databricks workspace and explore the examples. Each notebook contains:

- Working examples you can copy and customize
- Template code for creating your own diagrams
- Links to official documentation
